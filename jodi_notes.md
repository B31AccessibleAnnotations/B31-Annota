## Jodi's notes

Currently working on database + backend + frontend for one of mapview or timeline. I haven't decided yet.

Goals before Nov 20:
1. Figure out framework/library to use for timeline or mapview, whichever is easier at this point.
2. Put dummy info in database and build backend + frontend on the static database, in the meanwhile test different database designs.
3. If can finish some pilot of 1. and 2. then polish it before making database interactivity.
