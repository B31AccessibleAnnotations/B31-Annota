### Bread-and-butter workflow (? not sure if useful):

1. Jack and Jill wants to work on a project together in GitHub.
1. They clone the master repo to their local machines.
1. They split up the work so that they don't work on the same files at the same time (otherwise it's a nightmare when merging).
1. Jack is assigned to a task, for which there is an issue card in the project Kanban.
1. Jack makes a personal branch to do work on: jack/sprint_1_html.
1. Jack does work on his personal branch, adds and commits, and pushes his branch to github.
1. Jack then goes to GitHub website and makes a pull request, assigns himself, assigns Jill to review, and links PR with project issue.
1. Jill reviews, approves and merges Jack's PR; or reject/edit the code.
1. Once merged/resolved, Jack visits the project Kanban to make sure the issue card is in the correct swim lane.
1. Rinse and repeat with small variations (if all goes well).

### Basic shell scripts:

1. `git clone {repo link}` Repository link.
1. `git status` To check the status of your git.
1. `git checkout -b {student name/branch name}` Please follow this format when creating branches.
1. Make your changes. :shipit:
1. `git add .` or `git add -A` Dot adds all files, whereas -A adds all changes including deletions (choose your own adventure). `git add {filename}` Adds specific files.
1. `git commit -m` Followed with descriptive commit message in quotation marks, ex. `git commit -m "jodi changed default font"`.
1. `git pull origin {branch name}` Pull often to stay updated.

:exclamation: **For files such as .DS_Store, feel free to add it to .gitignore so we don't include every random thing in the project repo. Alternatively, add and commit specific filenames.**
